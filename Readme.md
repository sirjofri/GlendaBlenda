# GlendaBlenda - A Plan 9 Glenda 3d model

This 3d model is optimized for 3d printing.

## 3D print details

- The 3d model itself is scaled to a tenth number on a millimeter scale. Depending on the software you use, it's 1cm, 10cm, 100cm or anything like that to make scaling easier for you in the slicer.
- I try to minimize supports. In an ideal world, you don't need supports for this print.
- The eyes and ears are holes so the print looks good without coloring.
- The original artwork is created by Ren√©e French.
